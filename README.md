## Overview

This app is a simple product cart using ReactJS context API.

I'm using a Fake JSON API to server as my backend. React toastify to show toast errors.

## Installation & Running

Make sure you have the latest stable version of node and one package manager(**npm or yarn**).

Install dependencies with:

```shell
npm install OR yarn
```

Then, you will need to run the server, so the app can find it's data needed, you can do it with:

```shell
npm run server OR yarn server
```

Finally, run the application with:

```shell
npm run start OR yarn start
```

*OBS: make sure that the port **3000** and **3333** are available, because the app runs on 3000 and the backend fake server on 3333.*
